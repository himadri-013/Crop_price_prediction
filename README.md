# Crop_price_prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict crop prices based on historical data, weather conditions, market trends, and other influencing factors. The model aims to support farmers, traders, and policymakers in making informed decisions.

Features :

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses data, handles missing values, and performs feature scaling. Here I did not include the code for the data ana;ysis and visualization part
Modeling: Implements algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Evaluation: Uses metrics like Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² score for model assessment
